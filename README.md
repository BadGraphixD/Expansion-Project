# Expansion-Project
A SpigotMC plugin for Minecraft which adds RPG functionality.
## Concept
A hardcore fantasy rpg server, featuring custom items and creatures, a custom magic, skill, looting and combat system and potentially more. Completely overhauls the normal Minecraft experience by changing terrain generation, ore generation, mob spawning and more.
## Milestones
- Working corpse system: Players and mobs leave corpses on death instead of items. These corpses can be looted. Looting may require skills, certain items and has additional features such as rare items, item fragility and more.
- Skill system: Includes parent and child skills. Child skills can be leveled up by gaining experience. The higher the level, the more experience is required. Parent skills include a set of child skills. The level of the parent skill is the average of its child skill levels. Leveling a child skill has a chance to level other child skills under the same parent skill. Items/operations will require a certain skill level and can be used more successful the higher these skills are.
