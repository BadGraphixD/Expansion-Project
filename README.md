# Expansion-Project
A SpigotMC plugin for Minecraft which adds RPG functionality.
## Concept
A hardcore fantasy rpg server, featuring custom items and creatures, a custom magic, skill, looting and combat system and potentially more. Completely overhauls the normal Minecraft experience by changing terrain generation, ore generation, mob spawning and more.
## Milestones
- Working corpse system: Players and mobs leave corpses on death instead of items. These corpses can be looted. Looting may require skills, certain items and has additional features such as rare items, item fragility and more.
- Skill system: Includes parent and child skills (child skills level parent skills and vise versa -> one skill can indirectly influence another skill). Will include base skills which depend on your chosen role. Base skills influence the learning rate of child/parent skills. Items/operations will require a certain skill level and can be used more successful the higher these skills are.
